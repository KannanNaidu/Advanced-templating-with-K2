# K2-V3-templates
## A good starting point for your overrides

This a part of the K2 V3 project.

### Includes:
- HTML5 Markup
- Microdata
- Responsive Images with the srcset method and picturefill.js as a fallback
- BEM Architecture

### Notes
The naming used for the image sizes is based on the existing K2 V2 naming. If you are using your own custom sizes you need to update your code and include these new names.
